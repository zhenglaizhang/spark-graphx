JSON is a popular semistructured data format. The simplest way to load JSON data is
by loading the data as a text file and then mapping over the values with a JSON
parser. Likewise, we can use our preferred JSON serialization library to write out the
values to strings, which we can then write out.
 In Java and Scala we can also work
with JSON data using a custom Hadoop format.
 “JSON” on page 172 also shows how to
load JSON data with Spark SQL.
